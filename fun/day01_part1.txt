1. remove all the letters
2. duplicate the first digit (this is used because there are cases when we only have one digit in the entire string and we need 2)
3. get the first and the last digits
4. replace newlines with `+`
5. delete the last `+`
6. delete the line (will move it into the default register)
7. open the expression register with `ctrl+r` then `=` in insert mode (IDK how to show that)
8. paste the content of the default register with `ctrl+r` then `"`
9. press enter and you should have the answer
